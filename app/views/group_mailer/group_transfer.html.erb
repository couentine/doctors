    has transferred ownership of the 
    <%= link_to @group.name, group_url(@group) %> group to you in Badge List.  
    That makes you the new owner,
    with all of the awesome powers and responsibilities which that entails.

    <strong>Have questions?</strong> Reply to this email to ask the previous owner.

    <strong>Don't want the group?</strong> You can transfer it back by using the 
    "<%= link_to 'Transfer Group Ownership', edit_group_url(@group, transfer: true) %>" 
    tool. (The previous owner's username is "<%= @previous_owner.username_with_caps %>").

    Ownership of the

    group has been transferred to you in Badge List.  That makes you the new owner,

    <strong>Have questions?</strong> Unfortunately the previous group owner deleted his or
    her Badge List account after transferring the group to you, so we can't give you their info.
    But you can always contact Team Badge List at
    <a href="mailto:solutions@badgelist.com">solutions@badgelist.com</a>.
