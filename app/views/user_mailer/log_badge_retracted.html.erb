      One or more of the <%= @badge.experts %> for the <%= @badge.name %> badge have given you a negative 
      validation. (This means they offered the opinion that you have not yet mastered the badge.) 
      Due to this change, your previously issued badge has temporarily been retracted. For now you 
      are no longer one of the badge <%= @badge.experts %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you get the badge back? Not to worry! There are two ways. You can get the dissenting 
      <%= @badge.expert %>(s) to change their negative validations to positive validations. If possible, you can 
      also get additional <%= @badge.experts %> to weigh in. Once your validation balance is once again over 
      the threshold 
      (currently <%= pluralize @badge.current_validation_threshold, 'validation' %>) 
      you will be re-issued the badge. The first step is to check your <%= @badge.progress_log %> and read through 
      the feedback offered by the dissenting <%= @badge.expert %>(s).
    </p>

      <strong>Your <%= @badge.progress_log.titleize %>:</strong>
