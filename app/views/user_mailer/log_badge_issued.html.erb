        You have created a new badge in the <%= @group.name %> learning group. 
        You have automatically been added as an expert of the <%= @badge.name %> badge.
        Being a badge expert allows you to edit the main badge wiki and to help guide badge learners.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Some tips about validation:</b> In order for learners to be issued a badge they must
        receive validation from the existing badge experts (right now, just you). Since you are the
        first expert for the <%= @badge.name %> badge, your learning log has had an automatic
        "self-validation" added to it.  It's a good idea to update your self validation with some 
        information explaining why you are an expert in this badge.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish, you can now add this badge to your Mozilla Open Badges Backpack by visiting 
        your user profile in Badge List.

        The badge experts for the <%= @badge.name %> badge have validated your learning and issued 
        you the badge. You are now one of the badge experts, congratulations! Being a badge expert 
        allows you to edit the main badge wiki and to help guide badge learners.

        If you wish, you can now add this badge to your Mozilla Open Badges Backpack by visiting 
        your user profile in Badge List. Also be aware that all non-private entries in your learning 
        log are now visible and will be linked to the badge as public evidence of your achievment. 
        (You can change the visibility of your learning log at any time by altering the visibility 
        options in Badge List.)
