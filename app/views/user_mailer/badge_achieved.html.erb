      The badge experts for the <%= @badge.name %> badge have validated your learning and issued you the badge. 
      You are now one of the badge experts, congratulations! Being a badge expert allows you to edit the main 
      badge wiki and to help guide badge learners.

      If you wish, you can now add this badge to your Mozilla Open Badges Backpack by visiting your user profile 
      in Badge List. Also be aware that all non-private entries in your learning log are now visible and will be
      linked to the badge as public evidence of your achievment. (You can change the visibility of your learning
      log at any time by altering the visibility options in Badge List.)
