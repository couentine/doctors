          <h2>I. Statement Regarding Student Privacy Laws</h2>

          <p>
            As part of our commitment to transparency about student data privacy we want to state clarify our relationship to CA SB - 1177 (abbreviated "SOPIPA") and other laws like it that aim to protect student data privacy. Because Badge List is not "used primarily for K-12 school purposes" and was not "designed and marketed for K-12 purposes" SOPIPA does not apply to the software. We recognize that regulations set forth by SOPIPA function as excellent guidelines for student data privacy, however, and as such have chosen to comply with the following elements of SOPIPA:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>
                Badge List will not use student data except to make improvements to the software.
              </li>
              <li>
                Badge List will not create profiles of students other than for the purposes of education.
              </li>
              <li>
                Badge List will not target any students with marketing activities based on student data outside those activities that 
                inform users of new Badge List features or policies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Badge List will take reasonable security measures to make sure that student data is safe.
              </li>
              <li>
                Badge List will delete student profiles and associated data at the request of students, teachers, parents or school 
                administrators. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Badge List will never share any user data with 3rd parties except as necessary to enable us to provide our service or for 
                the purposes of providing better software and customer service to our users.
              </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Please note that it is the responsibility of the teacher to obtain parental permission for students under the age of 13. Those
            who are interested in stronger privacy features should consider our enhanced, premium privacy options, which which are
            summarized on our K12 pricing page
            (<a href="https://www.badgelist.com/pricing#k12">https://www.badgelist.com/pricing#k12</a>). 
            Please note that if you choose not to use enhanced privacy features, we recommend that you anonymize students’ usernames in
            order to maintain privacy.

          <h2>II. Information We Collect</h2>

          <p>
            We collect "Non-Personal Information" and "Personal Information." Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be
            used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit
            pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and
            number of clicks. Personal Information includes only your email, which you submit to us through the registration process at the
            Site.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Information collected via Technology</h3>

          <p>
            To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service
            thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service,
            we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the
            website you came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the
            Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information
            using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our
            servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-
            Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an
            individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information: login and session
            information, demographic details, browser and client information
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session
            and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. [For example, we store a persistent cookie
            to track whether you are currently logged in.].
          </p>
          
          <h3>Information you provide us by registering for an account</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a subscriber to the
            Service you will need to create a personal profile. You can create a profile by registering with the Service and entering your
            email address, and creating a user name and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your
            email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
